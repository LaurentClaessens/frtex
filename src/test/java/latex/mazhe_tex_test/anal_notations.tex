Some notations about functional spaces:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cdE(X)$ is the set of smooth functions on $X$ also denoted by $ C^{\infty}(X)$,
\item $\cdD(X;K)$ is the subspace of $\cdE(X)$ of functions with support in $K$,
\item $\cdD(X)$ is the union of all $\cdD(X;K)$ when $K$ runs over the compact subsets of $X$,
\item $C_{c}(X)$ compactly supported functions on $X$.
\item $ C^{\infty}_{c}(X)$ smooth compactly supported functions on $X$.
\item $\scrC_F(E)$ is the set of continuous maps from $E$ to $F$. 
\item $\cdD^{(0)}_{\eR}(X)$ is the set of continuous real functions with compact support in $X$,
\item $\scrD^{(r)}_p(X;K)$ is the set of the differential $p$-forms of class $C^r$ on $K$ when $K$ is a compact subset of the manifold $X$,
\item $\cdE^{(p)}_F(A)$ is the set of $p$ times continuously differentiable functions $A\to F$; if $p$ is not mentioned it means $\infty$,
\item $\swS$, the space of smooth rapidly decreasing Schwartz functions, page \pageref{not_swS}.
\end{enumerate}

Some distribution spaces:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $M(X)$ is the space of complex Borel measures on $X$, page \pageref{defMX}
\item $M_0(X)$ is the subspace of $M(X)$ of compact supported measures, page \pageref{defMzX}.
\item $R(G)$ is the dual of $ C^{\infty}(G)$. All element of this space are not measures.
\end{enumerate}

When $f$ and $g$ are real function, we write $f=O(g)$ if there exists $C\leq\infty$ such that $f(x)\leq Cg(x)$ for all $x$.
