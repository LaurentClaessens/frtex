The conclusion is that
\begin{center}
    \input{bar}\input{bar}
\end{center}
That procedure of decomposition is quite long because it requires to compute the complete set of weights for some intermediate representations.



The conclusion is that
\begin{equation}
    \text{\input{bar}}\otimes\text{\input{bar}}=
\end{equation}
That procedure of decomposition is quite long because it requires to compute the complete set of weights for some intermediate representations.
