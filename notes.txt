For using the actors package, I used the following command :

frtex>$ mvn  install:install-file -Dfile=../actors/target/actors.jar

That created the file
~/.m2/repository/actors/actors/0.1/actors-0.1.jar

Then it remains to add the following lines in the "dependencies" section of the pom file :

    <dependency>
      <groupId>actors</groupId>
      <artifactId>actors</artifactId>
      <version>0.1</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
